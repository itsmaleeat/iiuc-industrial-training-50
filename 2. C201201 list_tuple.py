This Python script is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of Python lists and tuples.
We will explore:
1. Lists - Creation, accessing elements, operations, and methods.
2. Tuples - Characteristics, usage, and differences from lists.
3. Advanced applications including 1D and 2D lists, and lists with mixed data types.

Each section includes detailed explanations, examples, and challenging assignments.

# Section 1: Python Lists
# -----------------------
# Lists in Python are ordered, mutable (changeable), and allow duplicate elements.

# Example 1: Creating Lists
simple_list = [8, 2, 9, 4, 5]
mixed_list = [1, "Hello", 3.14, True]
temp_list = []  # Empty list
empty_list = list()

# 2D List (List of Lists)
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Accessing Elements
# You can access elements by their index, which starts at 0.
first_element = simple_list[2]  # Outputs 9
second_row_first_col = matrix[1][2]  # Outputs 4
list_range = simple_list[1:4] # Outputs [2, 9, 4]
# list_stepping = simple_list[1:7:2]
list_stepping = simple_list[::2]
print(first_element)
print(second_row_first_col)
print("List Stepping: ", list_stepping)
print("List Range: ", list_range)

# List Operations
# Adding elements
print("Before Apprend Operation: ", simple_list)
simple_list.append(6)  # Adds 6 to the end
print("After Append operation: ", simple_list)
simple_list.insert(2, 6)  # Inserts 0 at the beginning
print("After Insert operation: ", simple_list)

# Removing elements
simple_list.remove(6)  # Removes the first occurrence of 6
print("After Remove operation: ", simple_list)
popped_element = simple_list.pop()  # Removes and returns the last element
print("Popped element:", popped_element)
print("After Pop operation: ", simple_list)

# List Methods
# Join lists
combined_list = simple_list + mixed_list
print("Combined List: ", combined_list)

# Sort lists
simple_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in place
print("Sorted List: ", simple_list)

# Copy a list
duplicate_list = simple_list

duplicate_list.append(7)
print("simple_list id", id(simple_list), "duplicate_list id: ", id(duplicate_list))
print("Duplicate List: ", duplicate_list)
print("Simple List: ", simple_list)

list_copy = simple_list.copy()
list_copy.append(8)
print("simple_list id", id(simple_list), "list_copy id: ", id(list_copy))
print("List Copy: ", list_copy)
print("Simple List: ", simple_list)

# Get the number of elements
list_length = len(simple_list)

# Assignment 1: Create a 2D list representing a 3x3 matrix and perform operations like accessing, modifying, and iterating through it.
# Write your code below:
# Creating a 3x3 matrix
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Accessing an element
print("Element at row 2, column 3:", matrix[1][2])  # Outputs 6

# Modifying an element
matrix[2][1] = 10  # Changing the value at row 3, column 2 to 10
print("Modified Matrix:", matrix)

# Iterating through the matrix
print("Iterating through the matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=" ")
    print()  # Newline for better readability

# Section 2: Python Tuples
# ------------------------
# Tuples are ordered collections like lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

# Example 2: Creating and Using Tuples
simple_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mixed_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14, True)
temp_tuple = ()  # Empty tuple
empty_tuple = tuple()


# simple_tuple[2] = 76768  # This will raise TypeError as tuples are immutable
print(simple_tuple)

# Accessing elements
first_tuple_element = simple_tuple[0]

# Tuples are immutable
# Trying to change an element like below will raise a TypeError
# simple_tuple[0] = 0

# Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because of their immutability
tuple_dict = {simple_tuple: "My Tuple"}

# Assignment 2: Create a tuple with mixed data types and demonstrate its potential use cases in data structures like dictionaries.
# Write your code below:
# Creating a tuple with mixed data types
mixed_tuple = ("Maryam", 25, "Engineer")

# Using the tuple as a key in a dictionary
employee_dict = {
    mixed_tuple: "Employee Record"
}

# Accessing the dictionary using the tuple
print("Accessing dictionary with tuple key:")
print("Tuple Key:", mixed_tuple)
print("Value:", employee_dict[mixed_tuple])


# Section 3: Advanced Applications
# --------------------------------
# Dealing with more complex list and tuple structures for real-world applications.

# Example 3: Advanced List Operations
# Filtering with list comprehensions
# even_numbers = [x for x in simple_list if x % 2 == 0]

# for x in simple_list:
#     if x%2==0:
#         print("Even: ", x)

even_numbers = [x for x in simple_list if x % 2 ==0]

print(even_numbers)


# Nested list comprehensions for 2D list transformations
incremented_matrix = [[cell + 1 for cell in row] for row in matrix]

# Assignment 3: Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a student's name and their grade. Sort this list by grades.
# Write your code below:
# Creating a list of tuples with student names and grades
students = [
    ("Aysha", 88),
    ("Borno", 75),
    ("Azman", 90),
    ("Wazid", 86)
]

# Sorting the list by grades
students_sorted_by_grade = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x[1])

# Printing the sorted list
print("Students sorted by grades:")
for name, grade in students_sorted_by_grade:
    print(f"Name: {name}, Grade: {grade}")


# Congratulations on completing the advanced section on Python lists and tuples!
# Review the assignments, try to solve them, and check your understanding of these versatile data structures.
